# <img src="https://github.com/Stephanie-Ta/Stephanie-Ta/blob/main/kirby_wave.gif" width="30"> Hello, I‚Äôm Stephanie Ta!

I‚Äôm a recent graduate of the **Master of Data Science** program at the University of British Columbia with a passion for leveraging data to uncover insights and drive solutions, especially in healthcare and conservation. I‚Äôm excited to apply my data science skills to create a positive impact and sustainable change.

I‚Äôm proficient in Python, R, and SQL, and I‚Äôm always eager to learn new tools and techniques to tackle complex challenges.

In my free time, I enjoy bouldering, knitting, and reading.

## üöÄ Projects

- [**Diverse Data Hub**](https://github.com/diverse-data-hub) | Jul 2025 - Present  
  Developed a [Python package](https://github.com/diverse-data-hub/diversedata-py) that provides real-world data sets centered on themes of equity, diversity and inclusion with example analyses available on the [Diverse Data Hub website](https://diverse-data-hub.github.io/). 

- **Forecasting Excess Mortality Due to Extreme Temperatures in BC, Canada** | _UBC MDS Capstone Project_ | Apr 2025 - Jun 2025  
  Collaboratively explored models to forecast excess mortality due to extreme temperatures across British Columbia's regional health authorities. Forecasts using the best model are displayed on an interactive **R Shiny** dashboard that updates daily.

- **Pneumonia Classifier** | _UBC Medicine Datathon_ | Mar 2025  
  Fine-tuned a pretrained DenseNet169 model with **PyTorch** to classify chest X-rays into categories: pneumonia, atelectasis, and others.

  Collaboratively built a logistic regression model using  **scikit-learn** to predict whether an online shopper will make a purchase based on their website interaction behavior. Developed a fully reproducible workflow with modular Python scripts, an automated pipeline with **GNU Make**, a **Quarto** report, and a **Docker** container.

- [**Patient Treatment Classifier**](https://github.com/Stephanie-Ta/patient_treatment_classification_project_online) | _Personal Project_ | Jan 2024  
  Tuned and evaluated a k-nearest neighbours model to classify in-patient vs. out-patient care based on various laboratory results and demographic data with **scikit-learn**. Presented findings in a [Jupyter Book](https://stephanie-ta.github.io/patient_treatment_classification_project_online/).
